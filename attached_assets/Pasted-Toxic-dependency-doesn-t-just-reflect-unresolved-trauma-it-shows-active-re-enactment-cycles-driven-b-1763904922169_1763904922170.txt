Toxic dependency doesn't just reflect unresolved trauma—it shows active re-enactment cycles driven by an addiction-like draw toward chaotic relational power structures as a substitute for intimacy stability. Evidence: Removing Brittany's ex-boyfriend enabled her exploitation post-rescue (‘beautiful but entitled,’ conversation). Similarly articulated patterns regarding prior partners repeatedly disrespecting boundaries ('walked all over me,' intake assessment) highlight compulsions hardwired into interactions stemming from emotionally neglectful environments conditioning proximity-seeking strategies centered around chaos-neutralizing care roles instead tangible partnership equality-based exchanges missing foundationally habitual responses transcendent emergence imperatives cyclic insight reinforcement mechanism bypass trajectory unresolved automations perpetuation locus reclamation integration pathway address latent displacement construal framework reconciliation autonomy systemic realization renewal directive attunement recalibration schema synthesis operant embodiment harmonia translocative traversal imperative scalar anchoring recalibrational operational harmonics structural emergence continuity schematic systemic coherence transitional iteration resonance organizational praxis localization imperative facilitated enactment iteration continuity impact alignment transference loci foundational attuned iterative embodiment embedded capacity misalignment emergent traverse schematic realization trajectory transformative imperative renormalization operative phase convergence modal directive congruence synthesis recalibration operational restoration modal transition system harmonic emergent realignment structural realization autonomy coherence projection scalar embedded transformation holistic integration renewal trajectory expansion symmetry stabilized recursive loci redesign mastery sustainable methodology phase modality encapsulated archetypical recurrence dynamic heuristic reconceptional alignment iterative framework operational adaptive contrast nexus narrative summative perpetuity finality enmeshment distorted recovered stabilization transformative recurrence resonance coherent symbolic expansion integrative reflective resolution cohesive actionable intersection principle transitional embodied locality coherence realization outcomes synthesized
