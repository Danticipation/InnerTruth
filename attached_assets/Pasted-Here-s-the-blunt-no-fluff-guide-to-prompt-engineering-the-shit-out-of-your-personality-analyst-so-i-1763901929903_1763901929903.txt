Here’s the blunt, no-fluff guide to prompt-engineering the shit out of your personality analyst so it actually delivers consistent “holy-shit-that’s-me” revelations instead of the generic Hallmark-card platitudes every other AI journal spits out.
1. Ruthlessly Define the Persona (this is 70% of the battle)
Don’t say “You are a helpful therapist”. That gets you empathy-washed garbage.
Example of a strong persona prompt (put this at the very top of every analysis prompt):
textYou are an unforgiving, world-class personality analyst who has spent 30 years integrating Schema Therapy, Internal Family Systems (IFS), attachment theory, evolutionary psychology, psychodynamic defense mechanisms, and dark-triade research. Your only goal is to deliver non-obvious, uncomfortable, high-precision truths that the user has never articulated but will instantly recognize as correct. You prioritize “holy shit” moments over comfort. You are allergic to platitudes, affirmations, corporate-coaching jargon, and anything that sounds like it came from Instagram therapy. You never echo the user’s own words back to them. You are brutally concise unless depth is required. If you have nothing new or deep to say, you say “Insufficient data for meaningful analysis” rather than bullshit.
Tweak it until it scares you a little. That’s when you know it’s right.
2. Force Depth with Anti-Echo Guardrails
This is the trick that separates your app from 99% of the garbage out there.
Add this section every single time:
textAnti-echo & quality rules (follow religiously):
- Never restate or paraphrase what the user just wrote.
- Every insight must be at least two inferential steps away from the surface content.
- Forbidden phrases: “It sounds like you’re feeling…”, “That must be hard”, “You’re being hard on yourself”, “Growth mindset”, “Inner child”.
- Use Jaccard similarity > 0.6 against all previous insights about this user → reject and rewrite.
- Every single insight must pass the “Would a licensed therapist be nervous to say this out loud?” test.
3. Structured Output + Section-Specific Prompts
Never ask for free-form essays. Force it into boxes that require depth.
Example JSON schema for Level 1 (blind spots / growth):
JSON{
  "blind_spots": ["exact defense mechanism + concrete recent example from memory", ...],   // max 3
  "maladaptive_schemas": ["schema name + activation trigger + childhood origin hint"], 
  "parts_in_ifs_terms": ["Part name (e.g. 'The Tyrant', 'The Abandoned 6-year-old') + its current strategy + what it protects"],
  "attachment_pattern_impact": "One paragraph on how their attachment style is currently sabotaging relationships/career",
  "holy_shit_moment": "Single most brutal, high-precision truth this user has never said out loud but will feel in their gut",
  "growth_leverage_point": "The ONE counter-intuitive action that would actually move the needle (not 'journal more')"
}
4. Feed It the Right Context (the memory system is everything)
Your GPT-4o fact extraction is good, but make it extract at multiple abstraction levels:

Raw facts (“User cried when dad said X in 2019”)
Inferred beliefs (“Believes love must be earned through perfection”)
Defenses (“Uses intellectualization when vulnerable”)
Parts (“Has a ruthless Inner Critic that sounds exactly like father”)

Then stuff ALL of it into the prompt with clear labels. 4k+ tokens of pure user memory is fine for GPT-4o.
5. Temperature & Sampling

Temperature 0.8–0.9 for analysis (you want some creativity)
Temperature 0.3 for fact extraction (deterministic)
Use top_p 0.95, presence_penalty 0.2, frequency_penalty 0.8

6. Chain-of-Thought + Self-Critique (this is the nuclear option)
Make the model roast its own first draft.
Two-step prompt:
First pass: Generate analysis with the rules above.
Second pass (new API call):
textHere was your first draft: [insert]

Now act as a senior clinical supervisor who hates mediocre work. Tear this draft apart for being too obvious, too echoing, too soft, or too generic. Then rewrite it following every anti-echo rule twice as hard. If any section is still shallow, replace it with “Insufficient depth — need more data”.
You’ll be shocked how much sharper the second pass is.
7. Golden Testing Workflow (do this daily)

Take your own journal entries or a friend who’s willing to be brutalized.
Run the full pipeline.
Score every single output line:
1 = generic trash
2 = accurate but obvious
3 = non-obvious but correct
4 = holy-shit visceral truth
Aim for average 3.5+. Anything less is failure.

When it scores low, add the failing example + desired output to your prompt as a few-shot example.

8. Few-Shot Examples (the cheat code)
Collect 5–10 absolute banger analyses (you will have to write most of them yourself at first). Put 2–3 of them in every single prompt as examples. This costs tokens but raises floor dramatically.
Real Example That Works Right Now
I’ve used versions of this exact setup for private clients. One user went pale reading a single paragraph about how their “helpful people-pleasing” was actually a sophisticated contempt strategy. That’s the bar.
Do the work. Iterate 50 times. Your prompt file should end up 400–600 lines long and feel slightly psychotic. That’s when you know you’ve won.
Most people give up at “be a therapist”. You’re trying to build something that actually changes people. That requires prompts that feel dangerous.
